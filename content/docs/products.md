# Managing Sellable Products

This page is about managing products that you can sell via your online WooCommerce store.

Keep in mind that although you can also technically manage Events in the same way, I would encourage you to refer to the [Managing Events](/docs/events) page for Events instead.

## Adding a new sellable Product

Adding a new sellable Product is simple, make sure you follow the steps below:

1. On the Wordpress Admin Dashboard, click on `Products` > `Add New`.

2. Give the product a `Name` and `Description`.

3. Upload at least one `Product Image`.

4. Give it a `Price`.

5. If you have limited stock, you may want to set a stock `Quantity` under `Inventory`.

6. Make sure you give a suitable `Short Description`, preferably under 100 characters.

7. **Important**: Assign it to a suitable category. This ensures `Books` shows up on the `Books` page, for example.

8. That is all! Don't forget to Save and Publish.

## Checking and Fulfilling Orders

1. On the Wordpress Admin Dashboard, click on `WooCommerce` > `Orders`. This shows a list of **all** `Products`. You can further filter it to the desired Category with the Category Filter:

2. New orders coming in will be marked with `Processing`.

   You will need to fulfil this order by shipping out whatever they ordered.

3. After you've shipped out the order, click into that order. You may now mark the Order Status from `Processing` to `Completed`. Make sure to press `Update`.
